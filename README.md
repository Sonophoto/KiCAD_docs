# KiCAD_docs
New documentation project for KiCAD 5.0

We needed documentation that can immediately get designers to work with KiCAD doing what they already know how to do: designing electronics. The following tutorials are arranged in a FAQ style and use a predefined workflow you can follow step by step. Please start at the beggining and work to the end of the tutorial the first time you use it. After that it easily serves as a reference weeks or months later.

Suggestions, are always welcome, PRs will always get a response (if not accepted), issues will be addressed.
