# KiCAD_docs
New documentation project for KiCAD 5.0

We needed documentation that can immediately get designers to work with KiCAD doing what they already know how to do: designing electronics. Essentially everything that comes back in searches is for 4.0.7 or older. Lots of it is not even dated or versioned.

We are looking to change that. Like our style? Contribute!
