# KiCAD_docs
New documentation project for KiCAD 5.0

@mmccoo and @evanshultz: Care to contribute? 

I want to start from scratch and build some docs that are more task/training oriented instead of the poorly curated list of icon tool-tips currently offered as documentation.

I need documentation that can immediately get designers to work with KiCAD doing what they already know how to do: designing electronics.

We choked on the Page Layout (or is it "Worksheet Layout") and spent several hours just getting basic changes implemented. Ridiculous.

Essentially everything that comes back in searches is for 4.0.7 or older. Lots of it is not even dated or versioned.

I can do this entirely open source if I can get at least one additional contributor.

What each of you choose to document is up to you.
